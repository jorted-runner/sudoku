Backtracking (Think like a programmer):
- What is it?
    - When solving a problem with lots of choices, a wrong choice can lead to a dead end. when a dead end is reached we have to go back to a position with different choices.
    - Recursive solutions are often a natural fit for backtracking, but it can be difficult to see the backtracking in recursive solutions
