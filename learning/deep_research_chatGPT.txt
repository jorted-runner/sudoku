Sudoku Puzzle Generation and Machine Learning Sudoku Solvers

Generating Sudoku Puzzles in Python (No Third-Party Libraries)

Overview: Generating a Sudoku puzzle means creating a fully solved 9x9 grid and then removing some numbers to form a puzzle that has a unique solution. We want to do this using plain Python (no special libraries). Two common algorithmic approaches are often used: backtracking search and constraint-based generation. The goal is to create puzzles at different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, evil) by controlling how many clues remain and how complex the solving logic is.

Backtracking Algorithm for Sudoku Generation

A straightforward way to generate a Sudoku board is by using a backtracking algorithm (depth-first search) to fill the grid, then removing numbers one by one while ensuring the puzzle is still solvable. The high-level steps are:
	1.	Generate a Full Solution: Start with an empty 9x9 grid and fill it completely with a valid Sudoku solution. This can be done via backtracking: place numbers one by one in empty cells, only placing a number if it doesn’t violate Sudoku rules (no duplicates in the same row, column, or 3x3 box). Use recursion and backtracking to try different numbers until the board is filled. For variety, you can randomize the order of numbers tried so you get a different solution each time ￼.
	2.	Remove Numbers (Dig Holes): Once you have a full solved grid, remove cells to create the puzzle. Remove one number at a time in some random order ￼. Each time you remove a number, check if the puzzle still has a unique solution (this step is crucial – it prevents creating an unsolvable or ambiguous puzzle). You can implement this check by using a Sudoku solver (e.g., another backtracking search) to attempt to solve the puzzle and ensure only one solution exists ￼.
	3.	Ensure Uniqueness: If removing a particular number causes the puzzle to have no solution or multiple solutions, then put that number back and try removing a different cell ￼. This way, you only keep removals that still leave the puzzle solvable with one unique answer.
	4.	Repeat Removals to Desired Difficulty: Continue removing numbers one by one (and testing solvability) until you reach the desired difficulty. The more numbers you remove (i.e. the fewer clues left), generally the more difficult the puzzle will be ￼. You might decide on stopping criteria such as stop when the puzzle has X clues remaining or after a certain number of removal attempts. For example, an “easy” puzzle might stop when ~35-40 clues remain, whereas an “evil” puzzle might have only ~22-25 clues given.
	5.	Result: The final grid with removed numbers (blanks) is your generated puzzle. It should have a single solution and can be adjusted in difficulty by how many blanks it contains and how tricky the solution is.

This backtracking generation algorithm is outlined in many Sudoku resources. Essentially, we generate a complete solution, then dig holes while checking that the puzzle remains uniquely solvable ￼ ￼. The approach guarantees a valid puzzle, though it can be computationally heavy if you try to remove too many numbers. Here’s a pseudocode sketch illustrating this process:

# Pseudocode for Sudoku puzzle generation
grid = [[0]*9 for _ in range(9)]  # 0 for empty
fill_grid(grid)         # backtracking fill to produce a full valid solution

for cell in random_order_of_all_cells:
    temp = grid[cell]
    grid[cell] = 0      # remove the number (make it empty)
    if not has_unique_solution(grid): 
        grid[cell] = temp  # put it back if puzzle is not uniquely solvable
# grid now is a puzzle with many blanks but still has a unique solution

Alternative solution shuffling: Instead of backtracking from scratch to get a solved board, another method is to start from a known solved Sudoku and shuffle it using valid transformations. For example, you can take a completed grid (like a simple one with 1–9 in order) and then randomly swap digits (e.g. swap all 1s with 5s, etc.), shuffle rows within the 3-row bands, shuffle columns within bands, or rotate the grid. These operations produce a different solved board without violating Sudoku rules ￼ ￼. This gives a quick way to get a randomized full solution. You would then remove cells as described above to create a puzzle. The advantage is speed (no heavy search needed to get a solution), though it limits you to puzzles isomorphic to the ones you started with.

Ensuring Unique Solutions and Difficulty Levels

When generating puzzles, ensuring a unique solution is paramount. The algorithm above uses a solver check after each removal to enforce this. Essentially, after each number is removed, we verify the puzzle isn’t solvable in more than one way ￼. This typically involves invoking a backtracking solver (or other solving algorithm) and confirming it finds exactly one solution.

Difficulty Levels: Sudoku puzzles are often labeled Easy, Medium, Hard, Evil (or Expert). The difficulty can be influenced by the number of clues and the complexity of logic required to solve. Generally, easy puzzles have more starting numbers and can be solved with straightforward elimination strategies, while evil (very hard) puzzles have fewer clues and may require advanced solving techniques. For instance, it’s known that a Sudoku with fewer than 17 clues cannot have a unique solution, so 17 is the theoretical minimum ￼. Easy puzzles might have 35-40 clues given, whereas evil puzzles might be closer to that 17 clue minimum (making them much harder for a human to solve). In our generation algorithm, stopping earlier (with more clues left) yields easier puzzles, while removing as many numbers as possible (while still unique) yields harder ones ￼.

However, difficulty is not determined by clue count alone. The type of logic needed plays a big role. For example, a puzzle might have a lot of blanks but still be easy if the next move is always a simple single-candidate fill. Conversely, a puzzle might have relatively fewer blanks but require tricky techniques (like X-Wing, swordfish, etc.) making it hard. As one source notes, “the number of starting numbers has little to do with the difficulty of solving a puzzle. The difficulty comes from the complexity of the algorithms needed to solve the puzzle.” ￼. In practice, puzzle setters often rate difficulty by attempting to solve the puzzle with a set of human-style rules: if only basic elimination is needed, it’s easy; if you need advanced strategies, it’s hard.

Researchers have even developed methods to quantitatively score difficulty. For example, a paper titled “Sudoku Puzzles Generating: from Easy to Evil” outlines an algorithmic way to generate and rate puzzles ￼. In one implementation inspired by that work, puzzles were given a difficulty score from 1.0 (easiest) to 5.0 (hardest) based on how complex the solving required is ￼. This kind of approach goes beyond just counting clues – it actually simulates solving and checks what techniques are needed.

In summary, to generate puzzles of different levels without external libraries, you can vary how many numbers you remove and which solving strategies the remaining puzzle demands. An easy puzzle will have many clues and typically can be solved with basic logic, while a hard or evil puzzle will have few clues and might require backtracking or advanced human-solving techniques to crack.

Resources for Puzzle Generation: The backtracking generation technique is widely discussed online. For a detailed explanation, check out the 101 Computing article on Sudoku Generator which describes these steps in a clear way ￼ ￼. Additionally, the Stack Overflow community has pointers to the “Sudoku Puzzles Generating: from Easy to Evil” PDF for deeper insights ￼. Eli Bendersky’s blog post is another great reference – it describes generating a random solved board and digging holes, and even touches on how to estimate difficulty programmatically ￼ ￼. These resources will help you understand and implement your own Sudoku puzzle generator in Python.

Machine Learning Approaches to Solving Sudoku Puzzles

Overview: Solving a Sudoku puzzle is typically done with search or logical deduction, but it can also be approached as a machine learning problem. For a beginner interested in machine learning (ML), Sudoku can be a fun playground to apply concepts like neural networks, reinforcement learning, and constraint solving. It’s important to note that Sudoku solving is a deterministic logic problem (a constraint satisfaction problem), so traditional ML is not the most efficient way to solve it – but using ML can help you learn the techniques in a familiar context. Below, we outline different ML-oriented approaches to solving Sudoku, along with fundamental concepts and resources for each.

Using Neural Networks to Solve Sudoku

Neural Networks (NNs) are typically used for pattern recognition, but some have experimented with using NNs to solve Sudoku by treating it like a pattern completion task. The idea is to train a neural model that takes a partial Sudoku grid as input and outputs a completed grid. This can be done with supervised learning if you have lots of solved puzzles as examples (input = puzzle, output = solution).

One approach is to use a form of deep learning such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn Sudoku. For example, one group of researchers tried using CNNs and LSTM (a type of recurrent network) to solve Sudoku puzzles; their study showed it is possible to train a network to fill in the blanks of a Sudoku correctly using deep learning techniques ￼. Similarly, a Kaggle/Medium tutorial demonstrates training an RNN in PyTorch that can solve all Sudoku puzzles in a given dataset with 100% accuracy ￼. This typically involves encoding the 9x9 Sudoku grid as input features (there are various encoding schemes, such as a 81x9 binary matrix or a 81-length vector with 0 for blanks) and having the network output 81 numbers (the completed grid). During training, the network learns to implicitly follow Sudoku rules by example.

However, using NNs for Sudoku is more of a learning exercise than a practical solver. Sudoku has clear-cut rules, so a neural net doesn’t discover hidden patterns unknown to us – it basically has to learn the rules or memorize solution patterns from data. A classic comment on Stack Overflow points out that a neural network is not naturally suited for Sudoku, since NNs excel at pattern recognition tasks (like image or speech recognition), whereas Sudoku is a pure logic problem. In fact, “framing Sudoku as a constraint satisfaction problem would work far better” than using a neural net ￼. That said, it’s a great way to practice building and training a neural network, and it’s interesting to see it work. Some tutorials even walk through building a Sudoku solver with a neural network from scratch (for example, creating a dataset of millions of Sudoku puzzles and solutions, and training a deep network on it). You can find such projects on Kaggle (e.g. “Neural nets as Sudoku solvers”) which show how with enough data and training, a NN can fill Sudoku blanks, albeit with much more effort than a simple backtracking algorithm.

If you’re a beginner in ML, tackling Sudoku with NNs will introduce you to key concepts like one-hot encoding of inputs, designing network architectures to handle a structured problem, and training with loss functions that enforce Sudoku validity (some formulations add penalties for rule violations). It’s a non-traditional use of NNs, but several blog posts and GitHub repos exist that you can follow. Keep in mind the takeaway: you can solve Sudoku with deep learning (and it’s fun to try), but it’s not the most efficient solver compared to logical methods.

Resources: Check out Medium articles like “Artificial Intelligence Solves Sudoku: Convolutional Neural Networks” or “Sudoku RNN in PyTorch” for step-by-step tutorials. There’s also a Stanford CS230 project report titled “Solving Sudoku with Neural Networks” that explores using CNN and LSTM models ￼. These explain how to format the Sudoku for a neural network and show the results. Kaggle notebooks (e.g. “Deep Sudoku Solver”) often provide code examples of training a neural net on Sudoku data. By following these, you’ll get a feel for how supervised learning can be applied to a puzzle solver.

Reinforcement Learning Approaches

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is another ML approach, where an agent learns to make a sequence of decisions by trial and error to achieve a goal. In the context of Sudoku, you can imagine an RL agent that fills the board one cell at a time and gets feedback (rewards or penalties) based on whether it moves closer to a correct solution.

In reinforcement learning, we define an environment and an agent. The Sudoku grid (with some cells filled, some empty) represents the state of the environment. The agent can take actions like “fill a certain empty cell with a number X”. We also define a reward signal – for example, +1 for every correct placement or for completing the puzzle, and perhaps negative rewards for illegal moves (violating Sudoku rules). The agent’s goal is to learn a policy (strategy) that maximizes reward, essentially learning to solve the puzzle. A Reddit discussion on RL for Sudoku notes that Sudoku’s strict rules and deductive nature make it a challenging environment for standard RL algorithms ￼. Still, it’s a compelling idea for experimentation.

To use RL, one might implement a Sudoku environment using something like OpenAI Gym. In fact, a few have tried this: defining a Gym environment for Sudoku so that standard RL algorithms (like Q-learning or policy gradients) can be applied ￼. The state would encode the current puzzle, and an episode would be filling all 81 cells correctly. The agent could be a neural network that takes the state and outputs an action (which cell and what number to fill). Over many episodes of trial and error, the agent should ideally learn which actions lead to a solved board.

In practice, solving a full 9x9 Sudoku via RL is quite difficult for a learning agent, because the state space and sequence length are very large, and a single mistake can invalidate the entire solution. Consequently, some experiments have started with simpler versions like a 4x4 Sudoku to make it tractable ￼. One blog (“Sudoku #3: Poor Man’s RL” by Kevin L.) describes an attempt to use reinforcement learning on Sudoku; the author notes that the approach was only feasible for 4x4 puzzles and isn’t effective for standard 9x9, calling it more of a fun exercise than a recommendable solution ￼. In that write-up, they clearly explain the RL setup: “Given a state, the agent can choose from a set of actions – to which the environment responds with a reward and a new state” ￼. This is a good read to understand how one might frame Sudoku for RL, and what the challenges are.

For a beginner, using RL on Sudoku will teach you about defining states, actions, and rewards, and using algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or policy gradient methods to learn a policy. Even if the end result isn’t an optimal solver, the process of modeling the puzzle as an environment is educational. You might learn how to encode the Sudoku constraints into the reward function or into the state representation to help the agent learn effectively.

Resources: Look for tutorials or papers on “Sudoku with Reinforcement Learning.” One academic project by Anav Mehta (as mentioned in the blog) explored some RL approaches ￼. There is also interest on AI forums about how an RL agent could mimic human solving strategies ￼. While there may not be as many ready-made beginner tutorials for RL as for neural nets in Sudoku, the existing experiments (blog posts and GitHub projects) can guide you. The Reddit thread in r/reinforcementlearning and Kevin L.’s blog post ￼ ￼ are good starting points to see the thought process and pitfalls. If you’re comfortable with OpenAI Gym, you could even attempt to implement a custom Sudoku environment and try training an agent with a simple algorithm, to see how it performs.

Constraint Solvers and Classical AI Methods

Because Sudoku is inherently a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), using a constraint solver is a very natural and powerful approach to solve it. This isn’t “learning” in the machine learning sense, but it’s often grouped under the AI approaches to solving puzzles. A constraint solver treats the puzzle as a set of variables (the empty cells) with constraints (the Sudoku rules) and uses systematic search and inference to fill in values that satisfy all constraints.

For example, Google’s OR-Tools (a free optimization and constraint programming library) can solve Sudoku by setting up the problem with 81 integer variables (one for each cell, domain 1-9) and adding constraints that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid have all numbers 1-9 ￼ ￼. The solver then finds a solution that meets all constraints. The process is very fast, because these solvers use efficient algorithms (like Dancing Links/Exact Cover, or optimized backtracking with constraint propagation). In a tutorial on using OR-Tools for Sudoku, Alberto Llamas explains how to model Sudoku in just a few lines: you create the variables, add the row/col/box constraints, and call the solver – it finds a solution almost instantly ￼ ￼. This approach doesn’t require any training data or learning; it’s essentially using logical techniques to directly solve the puzzle.

Another example of a constraint solver is the Z3 SMT solver or other logic solvers, which can also be used to declaratively solve Sudoku. There are YouTube tutorials demonstrating Sudoku solving with Z3, showing how to encode the rules and let the solver do the work ￼. For a beginner, using such tools can introduce you to the field of constraint programming and show you an alternative paradigm to both brute force and ML: you state the rules and let the solver figure it out.

Apart from dedicated solvers, the classic backtracking algorithm we discussed for generation is itself a form of constraint-solving using brute force. Implementing a Sudoku solver with backtracking in Python is a common beginner exercise and is very instructive. It teaches recursion and backtracking, and you see how the solver tries possibilities and backtracks when it hits a violation. Many tutorials exist for writing a Sudoku solver from scratch (without any library) – this is essentially what you’d use inside the generator to check unique solutions. If you haven’t built one yet, consider following a tutorial on that first ￼, as it will make the generation and the ML approaches clearer (you’ll understand what it means to “solve” in the context of evaluating a puzzle).

Why use ML vs Constraint Solvers? It’s worth noting the contrast: a constraint solver or backtracking can solve any Sudoku quickly by brute-force search + logic, whereas machine learning approaches (NN or RL) require training and are generally slower or probabilistic. The ML approaches are interesting for learning purposes or if you frame Sudoku as a learning problem (say, to mimic how a human might approach it or just as a challenge for an AI). Meanwhile, constraint programming is very efficient for this kind of problem – it’s the technique used by almost all serious Sudoku solving software. In fact, because Sudoku has a finite and small search space, a simple backtracking algorithm with some heuristics will typically solve an “evil” puzzle in milliseconds.

Resources: For learning constraint-based solving, you can refer to the OR-Tools official guide on Sudoku (for Python, Google has example code) ￼ or the Deep Life Learning article “Sudoku Meets Constraint Programming”, which walks through building a solver model step by step ￼ ￼. If you prefer a pure Python approach, Peter Norvig’s classic article “Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle” is highly recommended – it teaches a solver that uses constraint propagation and search in an elegantly concise Python implementation. And if you want to see a comparison of techniques, some Kaggle notebook authors compare a backtracking solver vs. a neural network solver in terms of speed and accuracy, which can be illuminating (the backtracking wins easily in efficiency, as expected).
