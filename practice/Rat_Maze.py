"""
Given a square grid of N x N with 0s and 1s where 1 represents an open cell and 0 a blocked one, find a path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell, moving only right or down.

Input:
The first line contains the integer N.
The next N lines contain N integers (0 or 1) each.

Output:
Print "YES" and the N x N path matrix showing the route using 1s.
If no path exists, print "NO".

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10
