DONE - 1 - N-Queen
    Given a chess board having  cells, you need to place N queens on the board in such a way that no queen attacks any other queen.

    Input:
    The only line of input consists of a single integer denoting N.

    Output:
    If it is possible to place all the N queens in such a way that no queen attacks another queen, then print "YES" (without quotes) in first line, then print N lines having N integers. The integer in  line and  column will denote the cell  of the board and should be 1 if a queen is placed at  otherwise 0. If there are more than way of placing queens print any of them.

    If it is not possible to place all N queens in the desired way, then print "NO" (without quotes).

    Constraints:
    1 <= N <= 10

DONE - 2 - Rat in a Maze
    Given a square grid of N x N with 0s and 1s where 1 represents an open cell and 0 a blocked one, find a path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell, moving only right or down.

    Input:
    The first line contains the integer N.
    The next N lines contain N integers (0 or 1) each.

    Output:
    Print "YES" and the N x N path matrix showing the route using 1s.
    If no path exists, print "NO".

    Constraints:
    1 <= N <= 10

3 - Knight's Tour
    Given an N x N chessboard, place a knight on the board such that it visits every square exactly once.

    Input:
    A single integer N.

    Output:
    Print "YES" followed by the board with move numbers from 1 to N*N.
    If a full tour is not possible, print "NO".

    Constraints:
    5 <= N <= 8

4 - Word Search in grid
    Given a 2D grid of characters and a word, determine if the word can be found in the grid by moving up, down, left, or right. Each letter cell may only be used once per word.

    Input:
    First line contains the word.
    Next lines represent the grid.

    Output:
    Print "YES" if the word can be found, otherwise print "NO".

    Constraints:
    1 <= Grid dimensions <= 20

5 - Palindrome Partitioning
    Given a string, partition it so that every substring is a palindrome. Return all such valid partitionings.

    Input:
    A single string of lowercase letters.

    Output:
    Print "YES" and each valid partition on a new line, with substrings space-separated.
    If no partitioning exists, print "NO".

    Constraints:
    1 <= Length <= 20

6 - Combinations of K numbers
    Given two integers N and K, generate all combinations of K numbers from the numbers 1 to N.

    Input:
    Two space-separated integers N and K.

    Output:
    Print each combination on its own line, with numbers sorted in ascending order.

    Constraints:
    1 <= K <= N <= 10

7 - Subset Sum
    Given a set of positive integers and a target value, find all subsets that sum to the target.

    Input:
    First line contains the target sum.
    Second line contains space-separated integers.

    Output:
    Print "YES" and each valid subset on its own line.
    If no subset matches, print "NO".

    Constraints:
    1 <= Number of elements <= 20

8 - Binary Strings Without Consecutive 1s
    Given an integer N, generate all binary strings of length N that do not contain consecutive 1s.

    Input:
    A single integer N.

    Output:
    Print each valid binary string on a new line.

    Constraints:
    1 <= N <= 16

9 - M-Coloring Problem
    Given a graph with N vertices and an integer M, determine if it's possible to color the graph using M colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

    Input:
    First line: two integers N and M.
    Next lines: adjacency list or matrix for the graph.

    Output:
    Print "YES" followed by one valid coloring.
    If no coloring is possible, print "NO".

    Constraints:
    1 <= N <= 10

10 - Generate Permutations
    Given a string of unique characters, generate all permutations of that string.

    Input:
    A single line containing the string.

    Output:
    Print each permutation on its own line, in any order.

    Constraints:
    1 <= Length of string <= 8
